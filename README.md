# Dev Test D

This technical responds to the following brief:

* NextJS
* TypeScript
* Chakra UI library
* Prisma with Supabase hosted PostgreSQL database
  * Use Prisma to define a schema and apply migrations
* NextAuth with Prisma adapter
* Apollo client
  * Query public GraphQL API
  * Gate data behind login
* Welcome modal
  * With 2 separate pages:
    1. Set up username
    2. Set up job title
  * Can (a) save data in app state, or (b) leverage NextJS API routes + Prisma. (I chose the latter)
* Deploy on Vercel free tier
